# Case Study Scenarios to discuss

## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
**Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.

**Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations

**Questions you may have and considerations:**

**Challenges (Why it's hard):**

*   **Shared Resources:** One truck might deliver to many stores, or one warehouse serves many. Splitting costs (fuel, staff time) fairly among them is tough.
*   **Indirect Costs:** Things like head office salaries, general building maintenance, or overall IT are hard to tie directly to one store or warehouse.
*   **Missing Details:** We often don't have exact data (e.g., *precisely* how many minutes a worker spent on *this specific* store's order).
*   **Constant Change:** Business operations shift quickly (new products, different delivery routes), making fixed cost rules quickly outdated.

**Questions & Past Experiences (What to ask and what I've learned):**

1.  **What data do we *really* need to collect?** (e.g., exact labor hours per task/location? Miles per delivery for each store?) My past experience showed that trying to collect *too much* data leads to errors and frustration; focus on the most impactful drivers.
2.  **How do we split shared costs fairly?** For example, if a central warehouse stores goods for multiple stores, do we split its rent based on sales volume, space used, or number of items handled by each store? I've seen success using **cost drivers** – things that directly consume the resource.
3.  **What systems can help?** Can our current computer systems track this, or do we need new tools or reports? Manually trying to track everything often fails.
4.  **How will this information help us make better decisions?** Will it show us which stores are less efficient, or where transportation costs are too high? The output must be actionable.
## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
**Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.

**Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**

**Cost Optimization Strategies & Outcomes:**

1.  **Labor Efficiency:** Improve staff schedules and offer better training.
    *   *Outcome:* Less overtime pay and faster order processing.
2.  **Smart Shipping:** Better route planning for trucks and using smaller packaging.
    *   *Outcome:* Lower fuel costs and more items fitting on each truck.
3.  **Inventory Control:** Keep only the stock you need and organize the warehouse so popular items are easy to reach.
    *   *Outcome:* Less money tied up in unsold goods and less time spent walking to find items.
4.  **Energy & Space:** Use LED lighting and better shelving to use all vertical space.
    *   *Outcome:* Lower utility bills and avoiding the need for a bigger warehouse.

**Questions and Considerations:**

1.  **Will this hurt customer service?** If we reduce costs, will deliveries take longer or will more items arrive damaged? Quality must stay high.
2.  **What is the "Upfront Cost"?** How much does it cost to start the strategy (e.g., buying new software or better shelves) versus how much we save later?
3.  **Are the employees on board?** Will these changes make work harder or easier for the staff? Happy staff are usually more efficient.
4.  **Can our current technology handle the change?** Do we need better systems to track the new routes or inventory levels?
5.  **What are the biggest "money leaks"?** Are we overpaying for shipping, or is too much money being spent on fixing errors?

## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
**Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
**Importance of Integration:**

Connecting the Cost Control Tool to our financial systems is super important because:

1.  **No Manual Work:** It stops people from having to type numbers from one system into another. This saves time and prevents mistakes.
2.  **One Version of Truth:** All numbers (costs, budgets) will match between systems. No more arguing about which report is correct.
3.  **Always Up-to-Date:** Financial teams and managers always see the latest cost data without waiting.

**Benefits for the Company:**

1.  **Faster Decisions:** Managers can see costs in real-time and make quick, smart choices to save money or fix problems.
2.  **Better Planning:** With accurate, live data, budgeting and future planning become much more reliable.
3.  **Spot Problems Early:** If costs go too high, the system flags it right away, so we can act fast instead of finding out weeks later.
4.  **Less Risk:** Fewer manual steps mean less chance of human error or fraud.
5.  **Easier Reporting:** Generating financial reports, audits, or cost breakdowns becomes much quicker and simpler.

**Questions and Considerations:**

1.  **What are our financial systems?** (e.g., SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks). What are their capabilities for connecting to other tools?
2.  **What data needs to flow, and in which direction?** (e.g., Cost Control sends detailed costs to Finance, Finance sends budget numbers back?).
3.  **How often do we need data to sync?** (Real-time, hourly, daily?). This impacts the complexity and cost.
4.  **Who owns the data once it's integrated?** Who is responsible for data accuracy in each system?
5.  **What about security?** How do we protect sensitive financial data during transfer and storage?

## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
**Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.

**Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**
**Importance of Budgeting and Forecasting:**

*   **Plan Ahead:** It helps us guess how much money we'll need for things like staff, trucks, and storage in the future.
*   **Avoid Surprises:** We can prepare for busy times (like holidays) so we don't run out of money, staff, or space.
*   **Smart Spending:** It helps us decide where to put our money to get the best results, instead of just guessing.
*   **Measure Progress:** We can compare what we planned to spend versus what we actually spent, to see if we're doing well or need to change.

**Designing a System for Accurate Budgeting and Forecasting:**

1.  **Use Past Data:** The system needs to look at what we spent in the past. What were our costs last year for labor, shipping, and storage? This is our starting point.
2.  **Connect to Other Systems:** It needs to talk to:
    *   **Sales Forecasts:** To know how many orders to expect.
    *   **Inventory Data:** To know how much we'll be storing.
    *   **Labor Management Systems:** To predict staffing needs.
3.  **"What If" Scenarios:** Can we easily test what happens if sales are 10% higher or 10% lower? Or if fuel costs double? This helps us prepare for different futures.
4.  **Clear Reports:** The system should produce easy-to-understand reports that show where money is going and how well we're sticking to the plan.

**Questions and Considerations:**

1.  **What historical data do we have available? Is it reliable and detailed enough?** (e.g., Do we know past labor costs *per warehouse* or just overall?)
2.  **What are our most significant cost categories that need forecasting?** (Labor, transport, rent, utilities, packaging?).
3.  **How frequently do we need to budget and forecast?** (Monthly, quarterly, annually? How often do we update the forecast?).
4.  **Who will be responsible for providing the input data (e.g., sales forecasts, operational plans) and reviewing the budgets?**
5.  **How will we handle unexpected events or sudden changes?** Does the system allow for quick re-forecasting?


## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
**Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.

**Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?

**Questions you may have and considerations:**

**Cost Control Aspects of Replacing a Warehouse:**

1.  **Shutdown Costs:** Money needed to close the old place (ending leases, selling old equipment, paying staff who leave, cleaning up).
2.  **Setup Costs:** Money needed for the new place (buying land/building, new equipment, IT setup, moving all the stuff, hiring/training new staff).
3.  **Transition Costs:** Costs during the move (maybe paying for both warehouses for a short time, temporary storage, potential slowdowns affecting deliveries).
4.  **New Operation Costs:** How much the new warehouse will cost to run daily (rent, utilities, labor, etc. – hopefully less than the old one!).

**Why Preserving Cost History is Important:**

*   **Compare "Before & After":** We need to know how much the old warehouse *really* cost to run. This lets us see if the new warehouse is actually cheaper, as we hoped.
*   **Set New Budget:** Knowing past costs helps us make a smart, realistic budget for the new warehouse. We're not just guessing.
*   **Spot Trends:** We can see if costs were slowly rising in the old warehouse (e.g., old machines needing more repairs) to avoid similar problems in the new one.
*   **Justify the Change:** It helps prove that buying the new warehouse was a good financial decision.

**Questions and Considerations:**

1.  **What's the exact cost of shutting down the old warehouse?** (Lease penalties, equipment disposal, staff severance?)
2.  **What's the exact cost of setting up the new warehouse?** (Construction, new tech, moving inventory?)
3.  **How long will there be an overlap period where we pay for both warehouses?** What's that cost?
4.  **How will we clearly separate the old costs from the new costs in our system, even with the same Business Unit Code?** (e.g., using specific start/end dates for reporting periods).
5.  **How will we handle the "archived" cost history so it's accessible for comparisons but not mixed with active data?**
